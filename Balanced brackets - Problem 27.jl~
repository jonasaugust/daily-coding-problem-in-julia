This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.
=#

function isbalanced(s::String)
    true
end

using Test

well_formed = ["", "([])[]({})"]
for s in well_formed
    @test isbalanced(s)
end
    
badly_formed = ["}", ")(", "([)]", "((()"]
for s in well_formed
    @test isbalanced(s)
end
    

#=
@test isbalanced("")
@test !isbalanced("("))
@test !isbalanced(")(")
@test !isbalanced("([)]")
=#
